The basic idea of the project is to club all the operations going on in a store and let the owner decide the views that the other category(Staff or customers) see on his web store. 

This project covers these aspects: -

a)Inventory Management:- For a business like a supermarket or any such store where the volume outflow of the stock is very high, the inventory needs to be managed                              properly. If let's say the inventory wrongly asses an item and orders too many of them, then they would stay in the inventory, wasting space                            and money and if the store orders something in a less quantity that is in demand then too the business will be heavily effected. So, for this                          we have provided a very friendly interface which shows the flow of the items that can help the store management decide how to invest for their                          further stock.

b)Suppliers Credit Management:- In this retail business the money is in the credit gap. But if the credit gap in not utilised properly then that could seriously affect                                 the suppliers and thus hitting the supply chain. So, to tackle this what we have done is provided an iterface where we clearly show how                                 many days are left to pay a particular supplier and thus making it easy for stores to know and control the flow of money. 

c)Staff Management:- Well in this aspect I do beleive that the world has far better products out there but still we did our best to provide the best experience                              possible for the store to manage its employees. 

d)Billing Interface:- The billing interface is linked with the inventory database so that whenever a bill is finalised immideatly the changes are reflected in                               inventory and also the bill is stored in the database.

e)Tax Management:- The billing interface stores every bill and thus is used to compute the tax that the store has to pay to the govt.

d)Customer Side:- The last and the most unique feature is that we have introduced a new system called the "PUL" which is the abbrevation for "Pick Up Later". With this                   feature the customer can place the order that he wants and  set a time like say he sets the time as 7PM. Then at 7PM when maybe he is returning from                   office he'll stop pickup the order that is ready and packed and go home! no need to take a trolley, surf through the floors and then finally stand in                   the billing queue and waste lots of time. This feature is unknown to the world and this is what we bring new with this project.

We have used Flask for the backend and SQL for databases.
